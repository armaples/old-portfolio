### RWD Examples

See below for examples of how the page was designed to be responsive.

The width of the body (and its content) will adjust based on the viewport:

If the viewport width is under 600px, it will display the content in a column:

Here is what the page will look like on an iPad Air and devices with a similar viewport size:

Here is what the page will look like on an iPhone SE and devices with a similar viewport size:
